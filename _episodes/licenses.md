General info on licenses
------------------------

Let's get started with a small exercise.

> ## Choosing a licence
> Go to <https://chooser-beta.creativecommons.org/> and follow the steps.
>
>- What licence did you arrive at?
>- Does the licence fit with the FAIR principles?
>- Discuss.
{: .challenge}

One of the key parts of FAIR data is that they are re-usable not only practically, but also legally. By attaching a licence to your work, you specify who can reuse your data, for which purposes, and what should be done with derived work. Creative Commons (CC) are the most used licence in research. They are widely recognized, easy to apply, and juridically sound. The CC licence is built on four cornerstones:

- Attribution (BY): Credit must be given to you, the creator.
- Share-Alike (SA): Adaptations must be shared under the same terms.
- Non-Commercial (NC): Only noncommercial use of your work is permitted.
- Non-Derivative (ND): No derivatives or adaptations of your work are permitted.

The six CC licences are combinations of these cornerstones.

> ## Note
> Without a licence you keep the copyright to yourself. This prohibits anyone from using the data for their own work.

These are some points to consider when choosing a licence:

- A licence cannot be revoked once the data has been shared.
- As the origial author, you can change the licence for future publications.
- Sensivite data / embargo
- The less restrictions you add to your data, the more it can be re-used

Licences in Geoscience
---------------------------

- CMIP5 and CMIP6 licenses (special case, example)

- CMIP6: https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/CMIP6/TermsOfUse/TermsOfUse6-1.html
- CMIP5: https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/mips/cmip5/terms-of-use.html
- CORDEX: http://is-enes-data.github.io/cordex_terms_of_use.pdf

>## Exercise
>- How do the terms of use for CMIP6 data differ from the Creative Commons licences? What about CMIP5?
>- Can you reshare the data?
>- Should you attribute the authors of the data? If so, how?
>- Can derived data be used commecially?
>- **FIXME**: check what the answer should be

License restrictions
--------------------

- share alike etc. for derived data


Institutionsâ€™ policies on licenses
----------------------------------



What does the EU (or other funding agency) require?
---------------------------------------------------



- When was the last time you published some data? What licence did you distribute it under? Where did you share the data? Discuss.

- Imagine you have downloaded some data from source X and applied operation Y on it. Which data licence should you put on it when you distribute the data? Which licence can you not put on it when you distribute the data?

- Take a few minutes to find out whether your institute has a license policy. What does it say? Discuss with other participants.
