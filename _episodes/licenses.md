General info on licenses
------------------------

Let's get started with a small exercise.

> ## Choosing a licence
> Go to <https://chooser-beta.creativecommons.org/> and follow the steps.
>
>- What licence did you arrive at?
>- Does the licence fit with the FAIR principles?
>- Discuss.
{: .challenge}

One of the key parts of FAIR data is that they are **reusable** not only practically, but also legally. By attaching a licence to your work, you specify who can reuse your data, for which purposes, and what should be done with derived work. Creative Commons (CC) are the most used licence in research. They are widely recognized, easy to apply, and juridically sound. The CC licence is built on four cornerstones:

- Attribution (BY): Credit must be given to you, the creator.
- Share-Alike (SA): Adaptations must be shared under the same terms.
- Non-Commercial (NC): Only noncommercial use of your work is permitted.
- Non-Derivative (ND): No derivatives or adaptations of your work are permitted.

The six CC licences are combinations of these cornerstones.

> ## Note
> Without a licence you keep the copyright to yourself. This prohibits anyone from using the data for their own work.

These are some points to consider when choosing a licence:

- A licence cannot be revoked once the data has been shared.
- As the origial author, you can change the licence for future publications.
- Sensivite data / embargo
- The less restrictions you add to your data, the more it can be re-used

Licences in Geoscience
----------------------

In general, data sources in geoscience such as CMIP5 and CMIP6 are available under FAIR licences. That is, you can freely use the data, but there are still some requirements. For example, if you base your research on CMIP6 data, you must give proper credit to the project if you deposit your research data somewhere. This is specified in the Terms of Use.

You can find the Terms of Use for some widely used projects here:

- CMIP6: <https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/CMIP6/TermsOfUse/TermsOfUse6-1.html>
- CMIP5: <https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/mips/cmip5/terms-of-use.html>
- CORDEX: <http://is-enes-data.github.io/cordex_terms_of_use.pdf>

>## Discussion
>- How do the terms of use for CMIP6 data differ from the Creative Commons licences?
>- Can you reshare the data?
>- Should you attribute the authors of the data? If so, how?
>- Can derived data be used commecially?
>- Can you find additional terms of licences that are applicable to your situation?
>- **FIXME**: check what the answer should be

Data ownership
--------------

Possible owners of the data:
- You
- Institute you work for
- Funding agency


You may be restricted by your institutionsâ€™ policies on licenses

Data ownership is defined in the data management plan


> ## Excercise
>Take a few minutes to find out whether your institute has a license policy.
>
>- What does it say?
>- Who owns *your* data?
>- What do you do if your institution does not have a policy?
{: .discussion}

> ## Excercise
> Imagine, some researchers have SOME CRAZY EXAMPLE
>
> They have deposited the data on their insitutes website under the data under CC-BY 4.0.
>
>- Do you see any problems with the licence they chose?
>- Which data licence should you put on it when you distribute the data?
>- Which licence can you not put on it when you distribute the data?

What does the EU require?
-------------------------

The European Commission has fully embraced the FAIR principles. Horizon2020 already mandates open access to all scientific publications, and is now running a pilot from 2017 for research data to be open by default with possibilities to opt out.

How the data will be licenced is part of the data management plan. Specificically:

- How will the data be licensed to permit the widest re-use possible?
- When will the data be made available for re-use (i.e. are the data under embargo)?
- Are the data usable by third parties (i.e. are there restrictions)?

In all cases, the Commission encourages researchers to provide access to their data in the broadest sense. They encourage authors to retain their copyright, but grant adequate licences to publishers. They recommend the Creative Common licences as a useful legal tool for providing open access.

How are licences applied to research data?
------------------------------------------

In principle, a licence is valid when it is mentioned or referred to in the same place where you upload your data. Some repositories like Zenodo allow you to select a licence, and they make sure it is clear under which licence the data are available.

You can apply a licence by one of these ways:

- Choosing a licence when you upload your data to a repository
- Referring to the licence on the webpage where the data are hosted
- Attaching the licence to the metadata
- Adding a readme file / licence file to your data

The [licence chooser](https://chooser-beta.creativecommons.org/) can help you generate a plain text or html snippet to add to your readme or website.

> ## Note
> Specific to climate related research, CMIP6 explicitly requires you to add the licence to the metadata
