Metadata are data about data. In other words, metadata is the underlying definition or description of data.
For example, author, date created, date modified and file size are examples of very basic metadata.

Metadata can make finding and working with the data easier. Therefore, they play an important role in making your data FAIR.
From a FAIR perspective, metadata are more important than your data,
because metadata would always be openly available and they link research data and publications in the
[Internet of FAIR Data and Services](https://www.go-fair.org/resources/internet-fair-data-services/).

Metadata can be created manually, or by automated information processing and preferably according to a disciplinary standard.
While data documentation is meant to be read and understood by humans, metadata are primarily meant to be processed by machines.

Metadata have to be added continuously to your research data.
