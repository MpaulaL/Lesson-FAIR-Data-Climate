## FAIRification practices and FAIR principles

We discussed each FAIRification practice, i.e. documentation, metadata, file formats, access to data,
persistent identifiers, and data licenses.
We also explained what a FAIRification practice means in a FAIR context. In summary:

> ## Make your research findable
>
> ![findable]({{ page.root }}/fig/findable.jpg)
>
> - Publish your **data** and/or **metadata** in a searchable resource such as a repository
>   that assigns a **persistent identifier**.
> - Include rich accurate machine-readable descriptive **metadata** and keywords to your data,
>   preferably according to your community standards.
>
{: .checklist}

> ## You make your research data accessible by:
>
> ![accessible]({{ page.root }}/fig/accessible.jpg)
>
> - attaching a **data license** or clear data accessibility statement in your openly available administrative metadata.
> - ensuring your data are archived in long-term storage and retrievable by their **persistent identifier** using a standard protocol.
> - giving **access** to the **metadata**, even if the data are closed.
{: .checklist}

> ## You make your research data interoperable by:
>
> ![interoperable]({{ page.root }}/fig/interoperable.jpg)
>
> - including sufficient and structural **metadata** in accordance with your research community’s standards.
> - using common standards, terminologies, vocabularies, and ontologies for the data.
> - preferring open, long-term viable **file formats** for your data and metadata.
{: .checklist}

> ## You make your research data reusable by:
>
> ![reusable]({{ page.root }}/fig/reusable.jpg)
>
> - attaching all the relevant contextual information in either the **documentation** or **metadata**.
> - including sufficient and structural **metadata** in accordance with your research community’s standards.
> - preferring open, long-term viable **file formats** for your data and metadata.
> - applying a machine-readable **data license**.

## Assessing FAIRness

FAIR is a journey. A FAIR assessment now is a snapshot in time.
Nevertheless, individuals and communities look to how FAIR their data are.
The reasons are various, including gaining a better understanding and making improvements.
Ultimately, an assessment can be a helpful guide on the path to becoming more FAIR.

The following are some resources and tools to help you get started.

- [FAIR-Aware](https://fairaware.dans.knaw.nl/) assessment tool.
- [Zenodo overview](https://about.zenodo.org/principles/) of how the service responds to the FAIR principles.
- A list of resources for the assessment of digital objects provided by [FAIRassist](https://fairassist.org/#!/).
- [Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the FAIRest one of all?](https://forschungsdaten-thueringen.de/entry/mirror-mirror-on-the-wall-tkfdm-announces-fairest-dataset-award.html).
- [The Australian Research Data Commons’ FAIR data self-assessment tool](https://ardc.edu.au/resources/working-with-data/fair-data/fair-self-assessment-tool/).

## Improving FAIRness

We provided recommendations, examples of steps you can take before, during and after your research project
to make your research data more FAIR. FAIR sounds like a lot of work. However, you can get started by:

- understanding how FAIR translates to your field/community.
- using standards that are common to your field/community.
- collaborating with other communities to define a relevant metadata scheme/standards.
- checking the requirements of the repository where data is stored.

> ## Make a checklist for your data
>
> Here are some questions about the use case you chose in the introduction of this tutorial,
> [here]({{ page.root }}{% link _episodes/introduction.md %}).
>
> We have explored [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/).
> Now, try to make a checklist to discuss:
>
> 1. how FAIR your research data are.
> 2. what measures could be taken to improve FAIRness of your data.

> ## Finding more guidance to go FAIR
>
> - Follow a framework guiding FAIRification e.g. [Three-point FAIRification Framework](https://www.go-fair.org/how-to-go-fair/).
> - Have a look at [Research Data Management starter kit](https://www.go-fair.org/resources/rdm-starter-kit/).
> - Ask librarians/expertise in information management for help with the process.
