## What is Accessible 

Accessible data objects can be obtained by humans and machines upon appropriate authorisation and through
a well-defined and universally implementable protocol. In other words, anyone with a computer and an Internet
connection should be able to access at least the metadata. It is important to emphasise that Accessible in
FAIR does not mean Open without constraint. Accessibility means that the human or machine is provided -
through metadata - with the precise conditions by which the data are accessible and that the mechanisms
and technical protocols for data access are implemented such that the data and/or metadata can be accessed
and used at scale, by machines, across the web.

From the FAIR principles:
**Accessible**
Once the user finds the required data, she/he needs to know how can they be accessed, possibly including authentication and authorisation.

A1. (Meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardised communications protocol

A1.1 The protocol is open, free, and universally implementable

A1.2 The protocol allows for an authentication and authorisation procedure, where necessary

A2. Metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available


## How to access data


- ESGF, first choice for any climate scientist?

- CDS, ??

- Climate4Impact for less technical audience

- Zenodo, (or other repositories)
    Small peace about zenodo and how to use it

- Website of a dataset

    Although FAIRness in climate science is advancing and some clearly accessible repositories exist, it is still also common practice to only make a dataset accessible via the project website. Because projects do not last for ever, some of these websites are not maintained, resulting in inaccessible datasets.
