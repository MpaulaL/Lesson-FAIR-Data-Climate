What is a persistent identifier?
--------------------------------

Persistent identifiers are important to make the data **Findable**

General info on DOIs and citing data (example ERA interim paper no. Citations; Dee et al)

Which data need a PID?
----------------------

CMIP5 and CMIP6 (lessons learned; version/concept licence)

Other (MIP) projects

Which datasets should we add an identifier to be FAIR?

How do you get a PID?
---------------------

Concept DOI: reserve a doi first, so you can add the doi to the dataset.

On zenodo, you can link to a project as a whole (general identifier) or to a specific version, with a version identifier.
This will make sure that the old versions are still accessible, but that it is clear which version they belong to.
This gives you a way to version your data.
